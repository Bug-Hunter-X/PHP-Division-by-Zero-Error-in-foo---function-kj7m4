# PHP Division by Zero Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP: division by zero. The `foo()` function does not correctly handle cases where either `a` or `b` is zero. This can lead to fatal errors or unexpected results.

The `bug.php` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.php` shows the corrected version with proper error handling.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in PHP applications to prevent crashes and ensure reliable functionality.
